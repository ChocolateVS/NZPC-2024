## **NZPC (NZ Programming Competition) Challenge Solutions**

Re-written after the competition as I can't access submissions from during the comp.

These solutions aren't necessarily a 100% correct, as the submission validation is closed. but most issues would likely be in the form of annoying string formatting to match the output correctly, or not handling an input bound

This was my first programming competition w/ @bertkdowns.

Our on the fly strategy for the comp was:
_Go straight for hardest challenges_

As we had to share a PC i began theorising a harder challenge, while bert started with a 3 point and a few 10 point challenges (the easy ones) to guage the level of the
challenges. Bert quickly solved a few.

Unfortunatley i focused on a challange that was way above my ability - the hardest one - for the majority of the first few hours.

Perhaps a better strategy would've been to focus on the first challenge in the medium or hard categories (usually the easist in that points category as we were told afterwards).
3 / 10 point challenges are not worth it as two 30 point challenges are worth more and would take less time.

We've learnt it's not worth the overhead in understanding, writing & debugging the easy challenges despite the code being trivial to write.

During the comp, we solved A, E, F, G, and K, but spent the majority of our time on challenges P and L

### Requirements

- Python > 3.11 (probably any python 3 version i haven't tested tho)

## Running the challenge scripts

Replace 'challenge' with the challenge letter i.e. `a`

`cat .\challenge\sample-challenge.1.in | python .\challenge\chall.py`
